# Machine Learning Projects

**Project 1:** Finding the Higgs Boson in a dataset from CERN. Project report can be read [here](Report_Project1.pdf).

**Project 2:** Detecting roads in aerial images using CNNs. Project report can be read [here](Report_Project2.pdf).


### Initial commit

The data files are to big to be uploaded, so you have to unzip them locally.  They are added to gitignore so that they can be stored in the data-folder.
